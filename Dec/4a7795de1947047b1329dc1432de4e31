They came as the shining light for a brighter telecommunications future for Nigeria, but they did not live to witness the future projected by their revolutionary services. Today, head offices of Code Division Multiple Access operators, the first private telecom companies in Nigeria, are occupied by other businesses, including one that has been turned into a shopping mall. SAMSON AKINTARO reports  The Nigerian telecommunications sector as it is today looks robust and flourishing even despite the hiccups of service quality that continue to give subscribers headaches. But behind this success story of over 160 million subscribers and still counting, are billions of investments that had gone down the drain. Pioneers of the telecoms revolution that delivered Nigerians from the inefficient monopolistic Nigerian Telecommunications company who are majorly Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) operators are still looking back to their investments in pains and regrets. In many Nigerian offices today, table phones have become mere artefacts, the days of calls beginning with the respective state prefixes such as 01, 02 09, have faded away. This is not because there is no more fixed line operators in Nigeria, but because a large number of operators of such lines who were providing services using the <img class="size-medium wp-image-174144 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CDMA-Code-Division-Multiple-Access-operators-the-first-private-telecom-companies-in-Nigeria.png?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CDMA-Code-Division-Multiple-Access-operators-the-first-private-telecom-companies-in-Nigeria.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CDMA-Code-Division-Multiple-Access-operators-the-first-private-telecom-companies-in-Nigeria.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">CDMA technology are dead. Today, CDMA technology, which was the dominant technology relied upon by the country for communications prior to 2001, only account for 0.1 per cent of market share of the Nigerian telecommunications market. Corporate lines dead Despite the growth of GSM, one distinguished factor that separated individual mobile lines from corporate lines was that they were usually ‘land lines’ which are fixed wireless services being provided by the CDMA operators. Corporate identities were incomplete without their fixed lines and calls from mobile lines claiming to be from a corporate organisation were usually termed suspicious. But today, the death of CDMA operators has forced many organisations to go mobile. The question is who goes home with the office mobile line?  According to the Chief Executive Officer of AA Infotech, Mr Akin Akinbo, while a few GSM operators still offer fixed line services that can be used by corporate organisations, most that were used to the CDMA service are now using mobile lines. “Who handles the office line depends on the organisation, in some, the receptionist takes custody of the phone and switch it off when its close of business. In others, the line is managed by the CEO. The fact is that table phone is still the best for corporate organisations, but the fixed line services being offered by some of the GSM operators are expensive, hence, many go for mobile” he said. No more family phone  From the days of NITEL when telecommunications was for the rich, families that can afford it usually have their homes. You could call the number to reach any member of the family. With the decentralisation of communications, the CDMA operators took over and the family lines remained the central means of communications with the homes, despite the proliferation of GSM. But today, there are no more family phones but individual’s mobile phones.  For Mr Femi Olusoga, one basic challenge his family is facing in the absence of fixed line is the difficulty in monitoring the home. “Most times when I call our maid on her mobile line, she claimed to be at home, whereas from the background noise, I could sense that she was not at home, but since the mobile allow that, there is nothing one can do. If it were in the days when our fixed line was working, such would not happen, because you have to be home before you can answer the call,” he said.   N30bn investments lost  While investors in the networks may have moved on, having also gained some mileage when the business was booming, Nigerians who invested in the shares of one of the leading CDMA companies then, Starcomms, remain the biggest losers. Starcomms had in 2008 raised N30.4 billion from investing Nigerian public through a Private Placement offer. The proceed of the offer was to be spent on network expansion and enhancement.  While private placements are privately offered and are restricted to qualified individuals, which typically mean individuals with certain net worth, Starcomms’, which was packaged by Stanbic IBTC turned almost turned public offer as more Nigerians, beyond the 50 recommended investors’ number put their money in it.  Being the first telecommunications company to go public and even at a time when the capital market was booming, the enthusiasm around Starcomms’ shares offer was much that it was over-subscribed. While the oversubscription resulted into court cases as many who had put their money could not get shares allotted, the company <img class="size-medium wp-image-174148 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zoom-Mobile%E2%80%99s-old-office-on-No-8A-Adeola-Odeku-Victoria-Island-Lagos-300x154.png?resize=300%2C154&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zoom-Mobile’s-old-office-on-No-8A-Adeola-Odeku-Victoria-Island-Lagos.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zoom-Mobile’s-old-office-on-No-8A-Adeola-Odeku-Victoria-Island-Lagos.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">thereafter got listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange with a promise to start paying dividends two years after. That promised was never fulfilled until company went out of business and was later deleted from the NSE’s official list in 2016. Many investors in Starcomms got their fingers burnt and until today, they are still counting their losses.  Gallant entry The arrival of Multi- links,  which started operations in December 1997 as the first private company to rollout fixed wireless phones in Nigeria brought a huge relief to Nigerians who had hitherto been at the mercy of (NITEL). The market became expanded as the likes of Intercellular and others join to wrestle power from the monopolistic National Carrier. Prior to this time, you had to be highly connected or have a deep pocket before you can get a NITEL line, but this changed with the arrival of CDMA operators in the country, which brought a kind of open market for telephony at relatively lower price. Later, the likes of MTS First Wireless and Mobitel joined the race to make telephony easier for Nigerians and access to telecommunications became available to all Nigerians in the urban areas.  Between 2005 and 2006, even after the GSM operators had been licensed, the CDMA continued to boom, especially with the arrivals of Starcomms and Visafone, who entered into the telecoms market in a big way, rolling out services across several cities in Nigeria.  Starcomms did the unexpected by getting listed on the Nigerians Stock Exchange in July 2008, thus becoming the first and only telecom company to be listed on the bourse. With the slogan ‘We Speak Your Language’ and a couple of near-smartphones sold for the first time on a CDMA network, Starcomms wormed itself into the heart of many Nigerians, overtaking the pioneer operators in terms of subscriber number and started rubbing shoulders with the GSM operators.  Dwindling fortunes  But the enthusiasm around CDMA operators was short-lived, perhaps as a result of the eruption of stiff competition among the GSM operators, prompting each to churn out myriads of innovative and exciting products for the subscribers and at the same time lowering call tariffs and cost of SIM cards. With such development, it did not take time before the tide started turning against the CDMA operators.  From then, number of subscribers on the CDMA networks began to dwindle. Conversely, GSM operators’ subscriber base continued to swell up to a point that even the last entrant into the GSM market could boast of subscribers well above the total subscriber base of Multi-Links, Zoom Mobile (formerly RELTEL), Starcomms and Visafone.  Most CDMA operators became cash-strapped to the extent that some started considering mergers and acquisitions. During this period, Telkom South Africa bought into Multi-Links and changed its name to Multilink-Telkom, while Visafone bought into Cellcom, ITN and Bourdex. MTN bought over Communication Network Support Services Limited (CNSSL). Other CDMA operators that could not get buyers were grounded, while very few like Zoom Mobile managed to maintain their subscribers and provide them services.  Although most telecom experts blamed the challenges on the exclusivity rights given to GSM operators by the telecom industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), which allowed them to operate for five years before NCC could licence other operators, some said the challenges went beyond that, and blamed it on fierce and unhealthy competition between GSM and CDMA operators, which largely affected their interconnect rate agreement.  Other analysts are of the view that the CDMA operators are the architect of their own problem as they failed to take necessary expansion steps when it was necessary. Some would say the operators had relaxed too much prior to the arrival of the GSM operators only to be caught unaware by the aggressive expansion drive of the later entrants. For Qualcomm, the chipset company that invented the CDMA technology, the focus was to grow fixed wireless operations and afford CDMA subscribers opportunities of enjoying cheaper rate in telephony services, but that has failed to materialise in Nigeria  By November 2011, Etisalat which entered the Nigerian market in 2008 to become the fourth GSM operator in the country had garnered about 10 million subscribers, whereas the total active lines for the four CDMA operators as at the same period had declined to 4.7 million, according to statistics from the Nigerian Communications Commission.  Before 2011, many CDMA operators like Intercellular, EMIS, ITN among others, had gone under, leaving only four operators struggling for survival in that segment. But the down trend in CDMA would not cease and would eventually consume Multi-Links, Zoom and Starcomms, leaving only Visafone, which eventually in 2016 got swallowed by the largest GSM operator in the country, MTN.   Better technology turns bad  On the strength of the underlying technology, CDMA operators globally are believed to be better equipped to deliver best of services at affordable costs to the consumers. And on that basis Nigeria would have been counted so ‘lucky’ to have had its first set of Private Telephone Operators (PTO) delivered services using the CDMA technology.  CDMA, a digital wireless technology that uses spread spectrum techniques is globally acknowledged as the better technology compared to GSM, given its inherent quality in terms of data speed and capacity. Unlike GSM, CDMA does not assign a specific frequency channel or time slot to each user but instead individual conversations are encoded with a pseudo-random digital sequence. By assigning unique codes to each communication to differentiate it from others in the same spectrum, CDMA allows many users to occupy the same space time and frequency allocations in a given band/space, thereby allowing many more people to share the airwaves simultaneously than do alternative technologies. It is also believed that   CDMA technology is more cost effective for operators as the CDMA capacity advantage leads to lower tariffs.  Consequently, that Nigeria started the telecom revolution with CDMA operators could have been seen as a plus for the country. Of course, the likes of Multi-links, VGC Communications, Intercellular were the darling networks of many Nigerians in the early days of the revolution with cheaper call rates compared to the new entrants GSM operators whose SIM cards were sold for as high as N30,000 then.  How they died  It would seem that the death of pioneer CDMA operators like Intercellular, EMIS, ITN among others, did not really spark the concern that there were serious challenges in the sector until late 2010 when the core investor in Multi-Links, South African Telkom, decided to pull out from the CDMA business citing unfavourable business realities. In fact, in a survey conducted in 2008, it was reported that there was a growing demand for CDMA despite the domination of the market by GSM technology. Affordability of CDMA phones and clarity of communication when compared with GSM were cited for this rising demand.  However, the reality was laid bare with the Multi-Links’ case. In an announcement that saw the exit of Telkom from Nigerian market, Multi-Links Telkom Nigeria’s Acting Chief Executive Officer, Vincent Raseroka, had said the decision to exit the market was purely based on business realities.”It is strategically, financially and commercially challenging for us to continue to do business in this segment. With a current market share of 2.6 per cent in a market dominated by the GSM technology, it has become imperative that we explore other options and chart a new path to growth and profitability for ourselves as a business by utilizing our fixed infrastructure here in Nigeria,”  He said despite the comprehensive turnaround programme of the company, the CDMA business in Nigeria was still facing stiff challenges in a highly competitive environment, requiring scale to successfully compete. According to him, the subscriptions and connections revenue of the company decreased 18.2 per cent due to termination of access fees as a result of increased competition. Traffic revenue decreased 24.6 per cent mainly due to decrease in traffic volumes and higher churn rates.  Struggle continued for Zoom, Starcomms  With Telkom out of the deal, Multi-Links was relegated to the background while a few Nigerians in the management of the company continued to salvage what was remaining of the company to sustain their services to a few loyal customers still on the network. But for Zoom and Starcomms, things were not the way it used to be. The revenue crunch was biting harder and to keep afloat, they began to shed staff. At some point, the few subscribers remaining on their networks began to complain of lack of service in some areas, and that was because their transmission radios on collocated base stations have been shut down due to their inability to pay the required rent.
All hopes seemed to have been lost for all the remaining CDMA operators except for Visafone, which continued to hold the CDMA ace by introducing some new innovative products, even though things were not rosy.   Failed rescue efforts  It surfaced like a ray of shiny light from a cloudy sky, many jumped up in ecstatic hope that at last, CDMA would not die in Nigeria. That was year 2013 when news broke that a group of core investors, with a company name called CAPCOM, were planning to invest $200 million into a new arrangement that would see Multi-Links, Starcomms and Zoom merged to become one strong CDMA operator.  The arrangement had gone through the necessary process with the approval of relevant regulatory agencies. From the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and of course the Nigerian Stock Exchange, all had given their nod to the deal. In the same vein, shareholders of Starcomms and other companies involved were said to have given their consent, thus giving the deal a smooth sail.  The deal document showed that Starcomms, the only listed telco in Nigeria (now delisted from the Nigerian Stock Exchange) was to be recapitalised with $ 90 million (Ninety million dollars) in addition to the injection of $110m (one hundred and ten million dollars) worth of assets. Thereafter, three companies, namely; Starcomms, Multi-Links and MTS would be consolidated to become one.  Unfortunately, the deal never came through. Despite having secured the approval of all regulatory bodies, the investors could not raise the required fund to seal the deal and that was how it hit the rock. Today, Multi-Links, Starcomms, MTS and Zoom are practically dead.   Visafone soon followed  While its initial strategies and aggressive roll out had helped Visafone to attain some levels and sustained the business for some time, the last standing CDMA operator in the country, was not finding it easy, to say the least. In April 2015, it was reported that the company had laid off about 60 members of its staff in the heat of the turbulence. And even though Visafone’s Public Relations Manager then, Joseph Ushighale, denied it. He admitted that there was an “ongoing routine reorganisation in Visafone like in any other firm seeking to remain in business”. But the reality soon dawned in January 2016 when MTN bought over the company to put an end to CDMA operation in Nigeria.  Why they die  According to the President of Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) Mr. Olusola Teniola, the extinction of the CDMAs in Nigeria had to do with the management of the companies involved as well as operating on a regional basis and not on national basis, rather than about pricing. “The forces that dictate the market chose the GSM technology for many reasons, and one of the reasons is that the SIM card can be divorced from the device and the devices, in my opinion, are actually, more smarter and lovelier in the GSM realm than in the CDMA”.  However, the Chairman of the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Engr. Gbenga Adebayo, said that CDMA fortunes could be revived if driven by new policies, stressing that while the technology is very expensive, “telecoms business has become a volume business. According to him, the CDMA operators tried to compete with big players, which they should not have done.    “Today, all our telecoms operators operate on a national basis, which to some extent shouldn’t be. If our policy encourages regional, state and local operations, there will be room for all players. Players will be more focused on their area of strength rather than concentrating totally on a national basis,” he stated.   OTTs as the new threat to GSM  But just like GSM technology disrupted the CDMA business in Nigeria and sent them parking, new technologies such as that brought out Over the Top services (OTTs) like Whatsapp, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, etc, have become major threats to GSM operators, not only in Nigeria but globally. Already, the telcos are losing billions of naira in revenue to the OTTs and the kernel of their problem is that people no longer send text messages, but would rather use the OTT platforms.  Already, an independent study by Ovum, a UK analyst firm, has forecast that the growing adoption of OTT services by customers instead of traditional telecoms services will cause global revenue loss of $386 billion over a period of six years (2012 – 2018) for the traditional telecom operators, thus endangering network development. However, there is no indication that the OTTs could push the GSM operators out of business as the latter did to CDMA.  While the telcos would want the telecom regulator to bring these unlicensed service providers under control through regulation, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has a different thought. The Commission had on various occasions declared that regulating the Internet or OTT would stifle creativity and innovation, and reduce the accelerated growth Nigeria is already recording in new media development.
