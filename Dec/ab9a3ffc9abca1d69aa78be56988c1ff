Despite the current investment apathy on the nation’s stock market, Research Analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, said the development is evidence that market optimism over the recovery of Africa’s largest economy has increased steadily. “As we head into the final trading month of 2018, the outlook for the Nigerian economy is poised to remain heavily influenced by oil prices, the Dollar, global trade developments and pre-election jitters,” he said.  “Although consumer prices in Nigeria eased in October to 11.26 per cent, government spending, and the new minimum wage are seen rekindling inflationary pressures. With the Fed expected to raise interest rates in December, Nigeria is at risk of experiencing capital outflows. Oil prices remain gripped by concerns over excessive supply in the markets and fears of falling demand – themes that may translate to falling government revenues and vulnerable Naira exchange.  “Investors will be keeping a very close eye on the pending GDP report for Q3, which should provide fresh insight into the health of the largest economy in Africa. Sentiment towards the nation could end the year on a positive note if economic growth during the third trading quarter meets or exceeds expectations.  “The presidential elections in February will certainly be a double-edged sword for the Nigerian economy. Economic growth has the potential to expand next year thanks to increased government spending ahead of the elections.”  He, however, said increased spending will inevitably rekindle inflationary pressures ultimately forcing the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to re-evaluate its monetary policy stance. “While speculations were initially rife over CBN cutting interest rates in an effort to support growth, rising interest rates in the United States and dollar strength resulted in CBN missing the window of opportunity,” he said.  “With the new minimum wage in Nigeria likely to stoke inflationary pressures and falling oil prices weighing on the naira’s peg against the dollar, higher interest rates may be enforced to maintain reserves.
