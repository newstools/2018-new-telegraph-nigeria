The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has debunked claim by some online media that no fewer than five corps members were killed in the recent communal clash between Ebonyi and the Cross River states, insisting that no corps member died in the imbroglio. The Cross River State Coordinator of NYSC, Mrs. Ambekembo Olufunke made this clarification yesterday during the passing out ceremony of Batch ‘A’ Stream Two for corps members in Calabar, the state capital. According to her, NYSC takes the security and well-being of corps members seriously and hence before the crisis, the corps members had already been relocated to their Local Government Area headquarters. She expressed surprise at the report, saying it was capable of creating confusion and unwarranted panic among parents of serving corps members in the state, while appealing to journalists to investigate such reports carefully before going to the press. “Reporters should investigate and get to the root of every report before they make their stories public. They should also not just sit down and cook up stories and make them public so as not to create fear in the heart of parents, whose children are undertaking their national service in any part of the country,” Mr. Ambekembo said. Meanwhile, the NYSC State Coordinator said about 1,484 corps members, comprising 725 female and 759 were male deployed to Cross River for the compulsory oneyear national service, took part in the ceremony.
