Ghana-born Nollywood actress, Juliet Ibrahim, has cast her mind to many years back when she had nothing and nobody could have envisaged she would become this comfortable and famous. According to the 10 Days in Sun City, “It started as a dream, tirelessly working from one set to another; filming over 6 movies in a month just to make a living.” Following days that she would have no choice but break down, Juliet said many of her loved ones would always be quick to ask: “Can’t you just take time off and rest?” Now celebrating owning her own house, she further wrote: “I’m extremely grateful to God Almighty who has been able to allow this nobody be a somebody! Many don’t know what being a refugee is like; literally she had nothing and had to start from scratch to get to where she is today. This is just the beginning of many more blessings to come because whatever you believe you can achieve.” The Glo ambassador, who is known to urge women to fight and make their own money is unshaken in her view that working hard would ways matter, a point she makes at the end of her message also. “Time and hard work makes a differ- ence!” she wrote with a number of hashtags.
