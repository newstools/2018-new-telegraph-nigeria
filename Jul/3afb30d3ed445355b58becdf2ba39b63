The Independent National Election Commission (INEC) has said it will deploy 11,000 ad hoc staff for the July 14 Ekiti State governorship election. Out of this figure, the commission is going to source 75 per cent from serving National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)members in Ekiti State, while the shortfall would be made up of students of federal institutions in the state. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at a quarterly meeting with the media yesterday, said all the staff who will conduct the election are being trained and retrained. He disclosed the only 630,000 out of 913,334 registered voters have so far collected their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).According to him, INEC will use enhanced Smart Card Reader (SCR) for the election. According to him, Ekiti will be the first state where the enhanced card reader would be used before the 2019 general election. “Both soft and hardware will be configured a few days to the election. As a matter of fact, the SCR machine will be configured on July 14,” he disclosed. He dismissed the possibility of hacking of SCR or pre-load of the card before the election. Prof. Yakubu stated that the commission would hold inter-agency security meeting today and has invited the commissioner of Police, Ekiti State and the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), to brief the meeting on security and other arrangements for the election. He said INEC would prefer strategic deployment of security, a situation where the commission directly supervised deployment of security personnel in areas needed. The electoral commission’s chairman expressed hope that the state commissioner of Police will not be redeployed on the eve of the election as has been the practice in past elections, noting that INEC always has difficulties working with a new commissioner redeployed to a state shortly before an election.
