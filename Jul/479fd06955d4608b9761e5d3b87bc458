Nigerian track and field athletes are set to embark on a peaceful protest as the Athletic Federation of Nigeria selection trial for the African Championships begins today in Abuja. Reports from Abuja indicated that the athletes among a list of grievances bothering on their welfare, are calling for the removal of the Technical Director of the AFN, failing which they might consider boycotting the trials for the African Championships billed for Asaba, Delta State August 1 to 5. “We have written to the police to make our intentions known. We are not going to compete until our major demand, which is the removal of the Technical Director, Sunday Adeleye, is met,” said a representative of the athletes yesterday. “We have asked for police protection to ensure that thugs are not brought in like they did in Ozoro. “It is about time we put our house in order. We cannot continue to pretend that all is well, when our sport is dying gradually.” Meanwhile, the Technical Director has said there is no cause for alarm, as the athletes are more educated now and they are not expecting any form of protest. It would be recalled that there was a case of protest by the athletes at the last Golden League in Ozoro, Delta State with the athletes also calling for the removal of Adeleye. Adeleye said some individuals were trying to instigate the athletes against the board by lying to them that the ministry released money to the AFN. He added: “What happened in Ozoro was a case of some of these athletes not even knowing why they were protesting; of course some of them have sent their apologies and expressed their regrets for been part of it. “Some people have been misleading the athletes telling them that some money was paid to the AFN, by the ministry and we are not doing anything. But now they have understood the truth and are sorry for their action. They have been informed about the situation on ground and they are now well educated.”
