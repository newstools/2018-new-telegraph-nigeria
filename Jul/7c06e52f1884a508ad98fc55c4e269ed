A swap deal that would have seen Moses Simon moving from KAA Gent to Liverpool for some cash as well as compatriot Taiwo Awoniyi moving in the opposite direction has appeared to have crashed. This was after Simon proposed move to the English Premier League did not go through and he will now have to try any other top leagues in Europe. Voetbalkrant also reports that Awoniyi, who shone at Belgian club Royal Excel Mouscron on loan from Liverpool last season, could now team up with champions Club Brugge. Awoniyi,20, scored nine goals in the league last term was for long linked with both Gent and Anderlecht. Both Moses Simon and Awoniyi featured for the Flying Eagles at the 2015 FIFA U20 World Cup in New Zealand.
