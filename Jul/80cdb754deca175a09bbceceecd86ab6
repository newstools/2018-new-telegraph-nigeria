Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike has urged the people of Ekiti State to resist any attempt by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to manipulate the governorship election result in the state. The governor, who spoke yesterday in Ado- Ekiti during the official presentation of flag to the Ekiti State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, alleged that INEC wants to rig the election for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He, however, tasked the people of the state to resist the move by defend- ing their votes through what he termed “Operation stay where you are.” Wike, who assured the Ekiti electorate of the support and best wishes of Rivers people, urged them not to be intimidated by the use of security agencies for the purpose of manipulating the process. He said: “If they like, they should bring missiles, stay put and defend your votes. Stay put at the voting centres until the results are formally announced. Everybody must be courageous and vigilant. Nobody should run away due to intimidation. Stay and demand a credible election because they don’t want to conduct a credible poll. They want to rig, but they must be resisted by the good people of Ekiti State.”
