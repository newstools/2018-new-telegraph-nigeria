A Federal High Court sitting in Makurdi, Benue State has sentenced Daniel Abende 39, from Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State to two years imprisonment for luring a 14-year-old into prostitution. Similarly, a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos, on Tuesday sentenced three women to jail for recruiting a 27-year-old young woman into prostitution in Dubai. The convicts were all arraigned by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP). In the first case, the convict recruited a 14 year old girl from Benue State and took her to Bayelsa State under the guise of getting her an employment in a restaurant. Upon arrival, the victim was instructed to work as a prostitute and hand over her earnings. The victim was able to contact her mother after some days, and her mother reported the case to NAPTIP. Head, Press and Public Relations Unit, NAPTIP, Nneka Aniagoh, said: “This action contravenes Section 13 of the Trafficking In Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration (TIPPEA) Act, 2015, which prohibits all acts of human trafficking, including the use of force, deception, coercion, etc. to recruit a person for the purpose of exploitation.” The presiding Judge, Justice Hassan Dikko, while delivering the judgment, took into consideration the fact that the convict pleaded guilty when the charge was read to him. Dikko said that the convict did not waste the time of the court in view of the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution. The Judge also noted that the convict was a first time offender and subsequently sentenced him to two years imprisonment without the option of fine. In the second case, the convicts were identified as Precious Owoh 29, Blessing Gabriel 25 and Rose Gabriel, 25. They were arraigned in court on April 20, 2016, by NAPTIP on a 4-count charge of recruiting a 27 years old young woman for exploitative prostitution.
