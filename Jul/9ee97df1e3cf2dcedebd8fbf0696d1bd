A little over a week after the death of his young son, Nigerian music superstar, D’banj, took to social media on Wednesday to issue a message of thanks to everyone who has offered his family support at their trying period. The former Mo Hits lead act, who has been mourning since his 13 months old son, Daniel Oyebanjo 111, died by drowning on June 24, wrote on Instagram: “We want to use this medium to thank everyone that has extended a hand of supported to us during this period. On behalf of myself and my family, we are awed by the demonstration of love and care from both near and afar. May God bless you all. From the Oyebanjos.” The sad incident, which occurred when D’banj was away in the United States for the BET Awards, led to an outpouring of tributes from far and wide, with many of his colleagues posting messages to condole with him and his family.
