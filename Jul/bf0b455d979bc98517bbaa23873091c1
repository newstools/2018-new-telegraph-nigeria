Victor Moses wing back position is under threat at Chelsea Football Club if new Manager Maurizio Sarri replaces Italian Antonio Conte before the start of the new season. Moses enjoyed his best ever time in England in the last two seasons under the Italian but the Nigerian star may not continue with such treatment under a new Manager. If Sarri opts for a different tactical-approach and formation, Moses needs assurances of first team shirt before he returns to the club for pre-season tour. Chelsea are close to naming Sarri as replacement for Conte – whose sacking is looming – and the former Napoli Manager is expected to take charge of the team’s preseason preparation from the Cobham training facility to the tour of Australia. Under Conte’s guidance, Chelsea won the English Premier League and FA Cup, both with Moses as a key squad member. Moses has been handed; at least, a two-week rest by his club before he returns to action after after Nigeria’s World Cup exit The Chelsea man scored only a goal and was not at his best during the ongoing World Cup finals in Russia.
