True to his nature as an unapologetically concise talker, iconic singer, Innocent Idibia, otherwise known as Tuface or TuBaba, has unequivocally confessed his love for women.
In a post on his Instagram handle, on Wednesday, 2Face said he is a straightforward person who loves women. “I like women, I dey straightforward,” he wrote.
And it’s incontrovertible from the chronicles of the 42-year-old Reggae star’s life. The African Queen singer has seven children from three different women.
Despite having children with other women, the Benue-born music act in 2013 married the girlfriend (who’d stayed the longest with him), Annie Macaulay, in a private ceremony in Lagos before the star-studded lavish wedding. And that particular union has so far produced two girls while the wife had jocularly said there’s no family planning until she gets a baby-boy.
