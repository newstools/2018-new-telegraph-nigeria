Itâ€™s no longer in doubt that famous actress, Toyin Aimakhu (Abraham) has granted his ex-hubby and fellow actor, Adeniyi Johnson, the divorce he once sought. And indications are rife that Adeniyi Johnson and Seyi Edun, who is also an actor, are secretly married. Johnson who recently revealed his plans to marry Seyi Edun slyly held back the wedding date until the two started releasing suggestive photos online. The actor has been spotted wearing a gold wedding ring for a while now on his finger. The actor who was treated to a secret birthday party by his godmother and Seyi Edun flaunted the ring severally and in ways even the blind would see. It may also interest you to know that although Aimakhu and Johnson still play hide and seek with their emotions, the separated couple express some jealousy in the manner they throw subtle shades at each other on the social media. We recall however that, months ago, there were reports that Johnson and Abraham were still legally married.
